# Acess Reader

Making browsing easier for the visually impaired with LLMs, and VLMs.

- We are trying to remove the hassle of screen readers which are the primary tools for blind people to browse the web. We propose that instead of having a blind person having to go through every single element on a webpage, 
LLMs given the intent of the user can filter out most of the noise not needed for browsing and reduce the search space of elements for blind people to navigate websites. This also allows people to navigate even websites that are not made accessible.

To start, run:

```bash
cd extension
cd npm install
npm run build
```

Then add the dist folder as unpacked extensiont to chrome.
